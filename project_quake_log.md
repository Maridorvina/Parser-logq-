# Quake log parser

## Task 1

Buid a project to parser the qgames.log file.

The file games.log is generated by a quake 3 arena server. It's registered all game information, when game start, finish, who kill, was killed and etc.

The project should be capable to read the file, group the game data of each game and then collect dead score.


### Example

  	21:42 Kill: 1022 2 22: <world> killed Isgalamido by MOD_TRIGGER_HURT
  
  The player "Isgalamido" died because he was wounded and fell from a height enough to kill him.

  	2:22 Kill: 3 2 10: Isgalamido killed Dono da Bola by MOD_RAILGUN
  
  The player "Isgalamido" killed the player "Dono da Bola" using the Railgun weapon.
  
For each game generate something like:

    game_1: {
	    total_kills: 45;
	    players: ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"]
	    kills: {
	      "Dono da bola": 5,
	      "Isgalamido": 18,
	      "Zeh": 20
	    }
	  }

### Observation

1. When `<world>` kill the player, the player lose -1 kill score.
2. `<world>` is not a player and should not appear in the list of players and even the kills in the dictionary.
3. `total_kills` are the kills of games, this includes deaths of `<world>`.

## Task 2

After building the parser, create a script that prints a report for each game (simply by printing all games in the same format of task 1) and a top ranking of kills per player.

## Plus

Generate a report of deaths grouping by death cause, per game.

Death causes (extracted from [c√≥digo fonte](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/game/bg_public.h))

	// means of death
	typedef enum {
		MOD_UNKNOWN,
		MOD_SHOTGUN,
		MOD_GAUNTLET,
		MOD_MACHINEGUN,
		MOD_GRENADE,
		MOD_GRENADE_SPLASH,
		MOD_ROCKET,
		MOD_ROCKET_SPLASH,
		MOD_PLASMA,
		MOD_PLASMA_SPLASH,
		MOD_RAILGUN,
		MOD_LIGHTNING,
		MOD_BFG,
		MOD_BFG_SPLASH,
		MOD_WATER,
		MOD_SLIME,
		MOD_LAVA,
		MOD_CRUSH,
		MOD_TELEFRAG,
		MOD_FALLING,
		MOD_SUICIDE,
		MOD_TARGET_LASER,
		MOD_TRIGGER_HURT,
	#ifdef MISSIONPACK
		MOD_NAIL,
		MOD_CHAINGUN,
		MOD_PROXIMITY_MINE,
		MOD_KAMIKAZE,
		MOD_JUICED,
	#endif
		MOD_GRAPPLE
	} meansOfDeath_t;

Example:

	"game-1": {
		kills_by_means: {
			"MOD_SHOTGUN": 10,
			"MOD_RAILGUN": 2,
			"MOD_GAUNTLET": 1,
			"XXXX": N
		}
	}

# Requirements

1. Make unit tests.
2. Use git and split your commits.
3. After finish, update the code in a private Bitbucket repository and grant read access to us.

HAVE FUN :)
